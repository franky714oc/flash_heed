{"name":"Flash heed","body":"FlashHeed: Fix Flash Ads That Go Above Your Content\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\nTired of flash ads (or other flash content) that ignore z-index and go over your DOM content on the page? Use FlashHeed to fix them.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that flash elements that don't specify a `wmode`, or set `wmode` to `window` will not preserve stacking order on your webpage. In fact, they will go above any content, no matter what kind of z-index voodoo you try.\r\n\r\nThis problem is easy to solve if you deliver and own the flash content: just stick `<param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\">` in your object tag and set `wmode=\"transparent\"` in your embed tags and you're good to go. But, what if you cannot alter the flash server-side? This is a common problem with flash ads, like Google AdSense.\r\n\r\nFor these situation, FlashHeed will dynamically add these paramters, taking into account various browser quirks.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nFlashHeed has been tested in Firefox 3, Safari 5, Chrome 7, IE6, IE7, and IE8. In other words, it should work in most major browsers.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFlashHeed has no dependencies. Just include the script in your webpage (preferably in the `<head>`):\r\n\r\n`<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"flash_heed.js\"></script>`\r\n\r\nA `FlashHeed` object will now be available.\r\n\r\nIt currently has one method: `heed`. Call it without any arguments like so:\r\n\r\n`FlashHeed.heed();`\r\n\r\nAnd it will fix up all the flash elements on a page. Or, you can pass in a scope, and it will only fix ads that are children of that DOM node:\r\n\r\n`FlashHeed.heed(document.getElementById('container'));`\r\n\r\nOf course, you should probably call this method onDomLoad.\r\n\r\nThat's it! Never again will your drop down menus and lightboxes be terrorized by flash ads!","tagline":"Fixes all Flash elements on a page so that they heed DOM stacking order.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
